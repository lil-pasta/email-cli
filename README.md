# email-cli
A simple CLI based application for checking email.

remember to fill out the .env file before trying to run the program or it wont work

I recommend using virtual environments when working with python.

There are a number of short comments with different features and functions to improve the program. The current incarnation is pretty bare bones and not particularly useful.

## To run:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 gmail-py.py`
